Diabetes Prevalence and Risk Factor Analysis

Project Overview
This project analyzes a diabetes screening dataset of 253,680 participants to investigate prevalence rates and risk factors like BMI and smoking1.

Key Findings
* Rising Prevalence: Diabetes prevalence increased from a 14% benchmark to 15.76%.
* Smoking Link: Statistical testing confirmed a significant association between smoking and diabetes status ($p < 0.001$).
* Demographics: The study population was significantly older (mean age 63) and heavier (mean BMI 28.8) than previous years.

Skills Demonstrated
* Programming: R (Tidyverse, ggplot2, patchwork).
* Statistics: Hypothesis testing (T-tests, Chi-squared, Proportion tests)
* Data Visualization: Absolute and relative frequency distributions.
